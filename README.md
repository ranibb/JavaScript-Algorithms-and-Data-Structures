**Define our own basic sorts using built-in JavaScript's sort method**

* The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function
* You can use this comparator function to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort
* The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value:
    * If it returns a negative number, a should come before b
    * If it returns a positive number, a should come after b,
    * If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned
