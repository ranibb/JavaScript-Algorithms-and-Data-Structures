## Frequency Counter Pattern

So, the idea behind the frequency counter, usually use an object and you use that object to construct a profile, sort of a way of breaking down the contents of an array or a string, Usually some sort of linear structure like an array or a string and then you're able to quickly compare that breakdown to how another object looks that was constructed from a string or an array.

So, we had two arrays. We break them down into objects that sort of classify what's in those arrays and then we can compare those objects and this allows us to improve our code significantly.

## Multiple Pointers Pattern

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.

Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

## Sliding Window Pattern

This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another.

Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
