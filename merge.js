/** Merging Arrays Pseudocode
 * 🔸 Create an empty array, take a look at the smallest values in each input array.
 * 🔸 While there are still values we haven't looked at...
 *       ◻️ If the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array, 
 *       push the value in the first array into our results and move on to the next value 
 *       in the first array.
 *       ◻️ If the value in the first array is larger than the value in the second array, 
 *       push the value in the second array into our results and move on to the next 
 *       value in the second array.
 *       ◻️ Once we exhaust one array, push in all remaining values from the other array
